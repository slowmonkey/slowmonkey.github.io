# How to start

1. Create a new docker container to develop in.
2. Must have nodejs.
3. Install aws-cdk globally on the container
4. Run the container bash console
5. Type `cdk init --language=typescript` to create an empty cdk project
6. Delete the .git folder created by the cdk init action so as not to conflict with the project git folder.
