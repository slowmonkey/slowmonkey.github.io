ingredients:
  - 1 lb. Bag (500 g) of Bucatini Pasta
  - 32 oz. (1 kg) of Peeled Tomatoes
  - 8 oz. (250 g) of Guanciale (or more, if you would like)
  - 4 (120 g) of grated Pecorino Romano
  - 1 Teaspoon Dried Pepper Flakes (Peperoncini) or 1 Whole Spicy Pepper
  - 1/2 small glass (4 oz) of dry white wine or chicken stock (my preference)
  - Salt to taste
instructions:
  - Cut the guanciale into strips and brown it in a thick-bottomed pan for a few minutes, until it starts to turn golden brown.
  - Drain the guanciale on a paper towel and set it aside.
  - Remove part of the rendered fat, leaving 2 tablespoons, and deglaze the pan with the white wine.
  - When it has evaporated, add the coarsely chopped peeled tomatoes (or sauce) and the chopped red pepper, season with salt and continue cooking for about 15 minutes.
  - Cook the pasta in well salted boiling water and cook until it reaches al dente, then drain while reserving 1/4 cup of pasta water.
  - Pour the pasta into the saucepan with the sauce, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of pasta water and mix it well.
  - Add the Guanciale and Cheese, mix and serve immediately.

I found having double the amount of tomatoes better. You can use the canned version or just buy punnets of mini roma tomatoes and cut them in half.
