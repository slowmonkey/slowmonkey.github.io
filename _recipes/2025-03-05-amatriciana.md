title: Bucatini allâ€™Amatriciana
ingredients:
  - 400g of Bucatini Pasta
  - 1kg of Mini Roma Tomatoes, sliced in half length ways
  - 250g of Guanciale or more
  - 120g of grated Pecorino Romano
  - 100-200ml of chicken stock, using about 2-3 teaspoons of stock powder
  - [Optional] Dried Chilli Flakes
instructions:
  - Cut the guanciale into strips.
  - Slice the tomatoes in half length ways
  - Prepare 100-200ml of chicken stock
  - Cook the guanciale starting from a cold pan on medium heat until it starts to turn golden brown with no oil in the pan.
  - Take out the guanciale and place in a bowl with paper towel
  - Drain the oil and set aside, leaving a few tablespoons of oil in the pan.
  - Deglaze the pan with the chicken stock.
  - On low heat add the tomatoes and cook for at least 15 mins. Helps to put a cover over the pan. Remember to stir regularly. You can add the chilli flakes now or add it at the end per dish served.
  - Cook the pasta in well salted boiling water and cook until it reaches al dente, then drain while reserving 1/4 cup of pasta water.
  - Pour the pasta into the saucepan with the sauce, sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of pasta water and mix it well.
  - Add the Guanciale and Cheese (you can leave this out for each person to add as they wish), mix and serve immediately.

Please note that I haven't followed the recipe exactly. The instructions and ingredients is how I prefer to do it. You can use pancetta if you don't have guanciale but it's not as good.
